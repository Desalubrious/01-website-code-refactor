## Code Refactor
My objective was to take a pre-existing codebase and apply my skills to refactor the code, and improve accessibility.
By improving the codebase, I was able to allow it to be easily updated and maintained if any changes or issues ever arise. I made the CSS more efficient and removed any redundancys and follow the semantic structure of the accompanying HTML. Elements are also neatly commented to increase clarity.
